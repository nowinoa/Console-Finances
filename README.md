# Console-Finances
## Description
This project aims to provide a comprehensive financial analysis of a company's profits and losses over a certain period of time. The analysis includes calculating the total number of months, the net total amount of profits/losses, the average change in profits/losses, and the greatest increase and decrease in profits/losses.

The motivation for this project was to create a tool that can quickly and accurately analyze a company's financial performance. This project was built to solve the problem of having to manually calculate and analyze financial data, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. By automating this process, the project aims to save time and improve the accuracy of financial analysis.

Through the development of this project, I learned how to use JavaScript to iterate through arrays, calculate sums and averages, and find the maximum and minimum values.
